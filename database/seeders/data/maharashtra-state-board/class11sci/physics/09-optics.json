This constant is called the refractive index. Formula: $n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin\\theta_2$.",

    "answer": "<strong>Solution:</strong><br>Step 1: Use Snell's Law: $n_1 \\sin\\theta_1 = n_2 \\sin\\theta_2$.<br>Step 2: Here, the light travels from air ($n_1=1$) to glass ($n_2=1.5$). The angle of incidence is $\\theta_1 = 60^\\circ$.<br>Step 3: Substitute the values: $(1) \\sin(60^\\circ) = (1.5) \\sin\\theta_2$.<br>Step 4: $\\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{2} = 1.5 \\sin\\theta_2 \\implies \\sin\\theta_2 = \\frac{\\sqrt{3}}{3} \\approx 0.577$.<br>Step 5: The angle of refraction is $\\theta_2 = \\sin^{-1}(0.577) \\approx 35.26^\\circ$.",
