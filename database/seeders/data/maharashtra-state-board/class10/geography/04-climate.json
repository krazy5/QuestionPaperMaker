    "answer": "The climate of India is greatly influenced by several factors:\n\n1.  **Latitude:** The Tropic of Cancer passes through the middle of India, dividing the country into tropical and temperate zones. The southern part is in the tropical zone and has a hot climate, while the northern part has a mild climate.\n2.  **Location:** India is surrounded by the Arabian Sea, Bay of Bengal, and the Indian Ocean, which influence the monsoon winds and rainfall.\n3.  **Himalayan Mountains:** The Himalayas act as a barrier to the cold winds from Central Asia, keeping the climate of North India relatively warm. They also trap the monsoon winds, causing heavy rainfall in the region.\n4.  **Monsoon Winds:** The monsoon winds are the primary factor influencing India's climate. The South-West monsoon brings heavy rainfall to most parts of India, while the North-East monsoon brings rain to the southern states during the winter season.",

The equatorial region has a hot and humid climate, while the southern part has a subtropical climate.\n* **Latitude:** The Equator passes through the northern part, and the Tropic of Capricorn passes through the southern part.\n* **Rainfall:** Brazil receives rainfall from the trade winds, especially in the eastern coastal regions and the Amazon Basin. The rainfall is more uniform throughout the year in many areas compared to India's distinct wet and dry seasons.",

The Equator passes through this region, resulting in consistently high temperatures throughout the year. The region also receives direct sun rays for most of the year, leading to a hot and humid climate. The vast Amazon forest in this region also contributes to high humidity and a stable tropical climate.",

They are responsible for the 'rainy season'.\n2.  **The North-East Monsoon Winds:** These winds originate over land and blow from land to sea during the winter months.

The leeward side, however, is a rain shadow region and receives very little rainfall.\n3.  **Seasons:** The region experiences more distinct seasons with cooler winters and warmer summers compared to the equatorial regions.",

    "answer": "India's climate is referred to as a 'Monsoon' type because the entire country's weather is primarily influenced by the monsoon winds. These winds have a significant impact on the country's rainfall and temperature patterns throughout the year. The distinct seasons—summer, rainy, and winter—are a direct result of the monsoon winds' behavior. The country's agriculture, which is the backbone of its economy, is heavily dependent on the timely arrival and withdrawal of these monsoon winds.",

    "answer": "The eastern coastal regions of Brazil receive heavy rainfall mainly due to the **South-East Trade Winds**. These winds originate over the Atlantic Ocean and are moisture-laden. As they blow towards the Brazilian coast, they are forced to rise due to the obstruction of the escarpment and the Brazilian Highlands. As the winds rise, they cool down, and the moisture condenses, leading to heavy orographic rainfall on the eastern slopes and coastal regions.",
