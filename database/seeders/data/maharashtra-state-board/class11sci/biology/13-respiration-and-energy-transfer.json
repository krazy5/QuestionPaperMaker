    "answer": "<strong>Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):</strong><br>The Krebs cycle is the central metabolic pathway in aerobic respiration. It occurs in the matrix of the mitochondria.<br><strong>Steps:</strong><br>1. <strong>Acetyl-CoA Entry:</strong> Pyruvic acid from glycolysis is converted into Acetyl-CoA, which enters the cycle.<br>2. <strong>Condensation:</strong> Acetyl-CoA (2C) combines with Oxaloacetic acid (4C) to form Citric acid (6C).<br>3. <strong>Series of Reactions:</strong> Through a series of enzyme-catalyzed reactions, the citric acid is systematically broken down, releasing carbon dioxide.<br>4. <strong>Energy Production:</strong> In the process, energy is captured in the form of ATP, NADH, and FADH2.<br>5. <strong>Regeneration:</strong> Oxaloacetic acid is regenerated at the end of the cycle to accept another molecule of Acetyl-CoA.<br><strong>Net Products per Glucose Molecule (2 turns of the cycle):</strong> 2 ATP, 6 NADH, 2 FADH2, and 4 CO2.",
