    "answer": "According to Raoult's law for a solution with a non-volatile solute, the relative lowering of vapour pressure ($\\frac{\\Delta P}{P_1^0}$) is equal to the mole fraction of the solute ($x_2$). \n$\\frac{P_1^0 - P_1}{P_1^0} = x_2$. \nWhere $P_1^0$ is the vapour pressure of the pure solvent and $P_1$ is the vapour pressure of the solution. Mole fraction $x_2 = \\frac{n_2}{n_1 + n_2}$. For dilute solutions, $n_2 \\ll n_1$, so $n_1 + n_2 \\approx n_1$. \nTherefore, $\\frac{P_1^0 - P_1}{P_1^0} \\approx \\frac{n_2}{n_1}$. \nIf $W_2$ mass of solute (molar mass $M_2$) is dissolved in $W_1$ mass of solvent (molar mass $M_1$), then $n_2 = \\frac{W_2}{M_2}$ and $n_1 = \\frac{W_1}{M_1}$.\nSubstituting these values gives: $\\frac{P_1^0 - P_1}{P_1^0} = \\frac{W_2 M_1}{M_2 W_1}$.
