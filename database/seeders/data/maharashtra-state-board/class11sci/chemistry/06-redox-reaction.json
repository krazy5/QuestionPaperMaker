Sn is a spectator ion, its oxidation number does not change.<br>3. The problem seems to be a typo. Let's assume the product is $Sn(OH)_6^{4-}$, which would have Sn at +2 oxidation state.

Sn changes from +4 to +2 (reduction). This cannot be a redox reaction. Let's assume the question meant $Sn(OH)_3^{-}$ as a reductant and $Sn(OH)_6^{2-}$ as a product. A common reaction is: $Bi(OH)_3(s) + Sn(OH)_3^-(aq) \\rightarrow Bi(s) + Sn(OH)_6^{2-}(aq)$ (basic)<br>5. Let's balance this more probable reaction. Bi: +3 to 0 (reduction).

Re-reading the provided problem, it is very likely a typo and the $Sn(OH)_6^{2-}$ is both a reactant and product, which means it should not have been included in the balancing process as it does not change. Therefore the reaction is not a redox reaction but a disproportionation reaction of Bi(OH)3. However, if we assume a typo and try to balance based on the other half of the reaction: $2Bi(OH)_3 \\rightarrow 2Bi$. This is a gain of 3 electrons per Bi, so 6 electrons total. We need another species to lose 6 electrons. Since the problem is likely flawed as written, it's best to state the flaw and provide the balancing for the most probable intended reaction.",

Change in oxidation state is +3 to 0, so 3 electrons gained. $Bi(OH)_3 + 3e^- \\rightarrow Bi$. To balance charge, add $3OH^-$ to the right: $Bi(OH)_3 + 3e^- \\rightarrow Bi + 3OH^-$. To balance O and H, add $3H_2O$ to the left: $Bi(OH)_3 + 3e^- + 3H_2O \\rightarrow Bi + 3OH^-$. Now there are 6 H and 6 O on both sides. This is the correct half-reaction.<br>2. **Oxidation half-reaction:** $Sn(OH)_3^- \\rightarrow Sn(OH)_6^{2-}$<br>   - Balance Sn: Already balanced.<br>   - Balance O and H with $OH^-$ and $H_2O$: Left has 3 O, 3 H. Right has 6 O, 6 H. Add $3OH^-$ to the left to balance O and H: $Sn(OH)_3^- + 3OH^- \\rightarrow Sn(OH)_6^{2-}$. This is balanced for atoms. <br>   - Balance charge: Left has $-1 + (-3) = -4$. Right has $-2$. Add 2 electrons to the right: $Sn(OH)_3^- + 3OH^- \\rightarrow Sn(OH)_6^{2-} + 2e^-$.<br>3. **Combine half-reactions:** The number of electrons gained (3) must equal the number of electrons lost (2). The LCM is 6. Multiply the reduction half-reaction by 2 and the oxidation half-reaction by 3.<br>   - Reduction: $2Bi(OH)_3 + 6e^- + 6H_2O \\rightarrow 2Bi + 6OH^-$.<br>   - Oxidation: $3Sn(OH)_3^- + 9OH^- \\rightarrow 3Sn(OH)_6^{2-} + 6e^-$.<br>4. **Add the two reactions together and simplify:**<br>   $2Bi(OH)_3(s) + 3Sn(OH)_3^-(aq) + 6H_2O(l) + 9OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow 2Bi(s) + 6OH^-(aq) + 3Sn(OH)_6^{2-}(aq)$.<br>   - Cancel out common terms ($6OH^-$ on both sides, $3H_2O$ is needed to balance, not $6H_2O$ but this is not how it is in the reaction, let me try again.) Let's redo the reduction part again from the start.<br>2. **Oxidation half-reaction:** $Sn(OH)_3^- \\rightarrow Sn(OH)_6^{2-}$<br>   - Sn: +2 to +4, so loses 2 electrons. $Sn(OH)_3^- \\rightarrow Sn(OH)_6^{2-} + 2e^-$.<br>   - Left charge: -1. Right charge: -2 + -2 = -4. Add 3 $OH^-$ to the right: $Sn(OH)_3^- + 3OH^- \\rightarrow Sn(OH)_6^{2-} + 2e^-$. Charge is now $-1-3=-4$ and $-2-2=-4$. O and H balance. This is correct.<br>1. **Reduction half-reaction:** $Bi(OH)_3 \\rightarrow Bi$.<br>   - Bi: +3 to 0, so gains 3 electrons. $Bi(OH)_3 + 3e^- \\rightarrow Bi$.<br>   - Left charge: 0-3 = -3. Right charge: 0. Add $3OH^-$ to the right: $Bi(OH)_3 + 3e^- \\rightarrow Bi + 3OH^-$.<br>   - Left O and H: 3 O, 3 H. Right O and H: 3 O, 3 H. Wait. This is not balanced. The $3OH^-$ on the product side must be formed from something. Let's add $H_2O$ to balance atoms. $Bi(OH)_3 + 3e^- \\rightarrow Bi + 3OH^-$. O balance: Left has 3 O, Right has 3 O. H balance: Left has 3 H, Right has 3 H. The charges are balanced with electrons. This is a correct half reaction.<br>3. Combine them: Multiply oxidation by 3 and reduction by 2. Total electrons = 6.<br>   - $3Sn(OH)_3^- + 9OH^- \\rightarrow 3Sn(OH)_6^{2-} + 6e^-$.<br>   - $2Bi(OH)_3 + 6e^- \\rightarrow 2Bi + 6OH^-$.<br>4. Add and simplify:<br>   $3Sn(OH)_3^- + 9OH^- + 2Bi(OH)_3 \\rightarrow 3Sn(OH)_6^{2-} + 2Bi + 6OH^-$.<br>   - Cancel out $6OH^-$ on both sides. $3OH^-$ remain on the left.<br>   The final balanced equation is: **$2Bi(OH)_3(s) + 3Sn(OH)_3^-(aq) + 3OH^-(aq) \\rightarrow 2Bi(s) + 3Sn(OH)_6^{2-}(aq)$**.",
