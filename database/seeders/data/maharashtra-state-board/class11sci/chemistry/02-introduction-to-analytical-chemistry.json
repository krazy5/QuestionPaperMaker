The reason is that these measurements reflect the precision of the measuring instrument, which is a meter stick graduated in millimeters. This means the measurement should be recorded to the nearest 0.1 mm or 0.01 cm, which is what these values do. 126.55 mm is equivalent to 12.655 cm, so it also has a reasonable number of significant figures for this kind of measurement.<br><strong>b.
