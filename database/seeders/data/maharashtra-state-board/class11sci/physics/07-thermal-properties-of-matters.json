    "answer": "<strong>Modes of Heat Transfer:</strong><br>1. <strong>Conduction:</strong> Heat is transferred from one particle to another through molecular vibrations without the actual movement of particles. It is the primary mode of heat transfer in solids.<br>2. <strong>Convection:</strong> Heat is transferred through the actual movement of particles of the medium. This occurs in fluids (liquids and gases). The heated, less dense fluid rises, and the cooler, denser fluid sinks, creating a convection current.<br>3. <strong>Radiation:</strong> Heat is transferred in the form of electromagnetic waves (infrared radiation). It does not require a medium for propagation and is the fastest mode of heat transfer.",
