    "answer": "The Reynolds number ($R_e$) is a crucial parameter in fluid dynamics used to predict flow patterns in different fluid flow situations.<br><br>The formula is $R_e = \\frac{\\rho v D}{\\eta}$, where $\\rho$ is density, $v$ is velocity, D is the characteristic length (like pipe diameter), and $\\eta$ is the dynamic viscosity.<br><br>The nature of the flow is typically characterized by the value of $R_e$ as follows:<br>- <b>$R_e < 1000$ (or sometimes < 2000):</b> The flow is dominated by viscous forces and is smooth and orderly. This type of flow is called <b>laminar flow</b> or <b>streamline flow</b>.<br>- <b>$1000 < R_e < 2000$ (or $2000 < R_e < 4000$):</b> The flow is unstable and is in a transitional phase between laminar and turbulent.<br>- <b>$R_e > 2000$ (or > 4000):</b> The flow is dominated by inertial forces, leading to chaotic eddies, vortices, and other flow instabilities. This is known as <b>turbulent flow</b>.<br><br>Since the given Reynolds number is less than 1000, the flow is streamline or laminar.<br><br><b>Correct option is (b).</b>",
