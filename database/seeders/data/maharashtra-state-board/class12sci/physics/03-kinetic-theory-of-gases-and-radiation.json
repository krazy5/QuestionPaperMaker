Let $E_A$ and $E_B$ be the emissive powers of bodies A and B, and $a_A$ and $a_B$ be their coefficients of absorption, respectively. <br>The energy radiated by a body is absorbed by the enclosure walls, which in turn radiates the same amount of energy.

    "answer": "This problem uses the Stefan-Boltzmann law with a surrounding enclosure. The net rate of heat loss is given by $P_{net} = A\\sigma(T^4 - T_0^4)$, where $T$ is the temperature of the blackbody and $T_0$ is the temperature of the enclosure. <br>Given: <br>First blackbody temperature $T_1 = 727^\\circ C = 727+273 = 1000$ K. <br>Second blackbody temperature $T_2 = 227^\\circ C = 227+273 = 500$ K. <br>Enclosure temperature $T_0 = 27^\\circ C = 27+273 = 300$ K. <br>We want to find the ratio of their rates of emission of heat, which is $P_1/P_2$. Assuming the surface area $A$ is the same for both bodies. <br>$$\\frac{P_1}{P_2} = \\frac{A\\sigma(T_1^4 - T_0^4)}{A\\sigma(T_2^4 - T_0^4)} = \\frac{1000^4 - 300^4}{500^4 - 300^4} = \\frac{100^4(10^4 - 3^4)}{100^4(5^4 - 3^4)} = \\frac{10000-81}{625-81} = \\frac{9919}{544} \\approx 18.23$$ <br>The ratio of their rates of loss of heat is approximately **18.23:1**.",

    "answer": "This problem uses Wien's displacement law, $\\lambda_{max} T = b$. The curve of blackbody radiation for Earth's mean temperature would be similar to a standard blackbody radiation curve, but with its peak shifted to longer wavelengths compared to, say, the sun's radiation, because Earth's temperature is much lower. <br>Given: <br>Temperature $T = 280$ K. <br>Wien's constant $b = 2.897 \\times 10^{-3} \\text{ m K}$. <br>We need to find $\\lambda_{max}$.
