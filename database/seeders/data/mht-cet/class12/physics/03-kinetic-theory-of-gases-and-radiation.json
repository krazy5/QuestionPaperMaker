This is the $\\gamma$ for a monoatomic gas. It is possible the question intended to ask about a monoatomic gas and not use the value $\\gamma = 1.4$. I will provide the answer assuming the question meant to give a monoatomic gas value and the intended answer is based on $\\gamma = 5/3$. This is a common pattern for flawed questions. <br><br>The relation for an adiabatic process is $P_1 V_1^\\gamma = P_2 V_2^\\gamma$.<br>The final pressure is $P_2 = P_1 (V_1/V_2)^\\gamma$.<br>Given $V_2 = 8V_1$, so $V_1/V_2 = 1/8$.<br>The value $\\gamma = 1.4$ for a diatomic gas leads to $P_2 = P (1/8)^{1.4} \\approx P/18.36$. This does not match any option.<br>However, if the gas were monoatomic, $\\gamma = 5/3$. Then:<br>$P_2 = P (1/8)^{5/3} = P ((1/2)^3)^{5/3} = P (1/2)^5 = P/32$.<br>This matches option (c). It is highly likely the question intended to be about a monoatomic gas, or there is a typo in the value of $\\gamma$ given in the question.<br><br><b>Correct option is (c).</b>",
