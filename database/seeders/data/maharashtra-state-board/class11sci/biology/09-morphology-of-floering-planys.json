Examples include conical roots (Carrot), fusiform roots (Radish), and napiform roots (Turnip).<br>2. <strong>For Support:</strong> These provide additional mechanical support. Examples include prop roots (Banyan tree) which grow vertically downwards from branches, and stilt roots (Maize, Sugarcane) which arise from the lower nodes of the stem.<br>3. <strong>For Respiration:</strong> In marshy areas, some plants develop specialized roots called pneumatophores that grow vertically upwards (negatively geotropic) to get oxygen.
