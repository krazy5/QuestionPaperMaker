Kneel to another.<br><br><b>A2.</b> The poet's attitude towards the animals is one of admiration and longing. He wishes he could live with them because he finds them to be calm, self-sufficient, and content. He feels this way because they do not possess the complexities and vices like greed, guilt, and hypocrisy that are common in human beings.<br><br><b>A3.</b> The figure of speech is <b>Repetition</b>.

    "answer": "<b>Appreciation of the Poem</b><br><br><b>About the Poem/Poet:</b> The poem 'Animals' is written by the famous American poet Walt Whitman. It is taken from his major work, 'Song of Myself' in 'Leaves of Grass'. The title is simple and direct, indicating the subject of the poem.<br><br><b>Theme:</b> The central theme is the poet's praise for the life of animals, which he considers superior to that of human beings. He contrasts the calm, simple, and honest nature of animals with the complicated, greedy, and hypocritical nature of humans.<br><br><b>Poetic Style and Devices:</b> The poem is written in free verse, which is a characteristic style of Walt Whitman. It does not have a regular rhyme scheme or meter. The poet uses several figures of speech, including <b>Repetition</b> ('long and long'), <b>Alliteration</b> ('sweat and whine'), and <b>Tautology</b> ('placid and self-contain'd'). The rhetorical question at the end, 'Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?', is also a key feature.<br><br><b>Special Features/Message:</b> The poem's special feature is its direct and powerful comparison between animal and human virtues. The message is a critique of human society and a call to return to the simple, honest virtues ('tokens') that animals seem to possess, but which humans have lost.<br><br><b>My Opinion:</b> I find this poem very thought-provoking. It makes us reflect on the negative traits that have become common in human society. The poet's admiration for the simple and content life of animals is a powerful reminder of the values we have forgotten.",

    "text": "What are the 'tokens' that the poet says he may have dropped long ago?",
    "answer": "The 'tokens' refer to the innate qualities of innocence, simplicity, contentment, and honesty. The poet believes that human beings once possessed these virtues but have negligently lost them over time in their pursuit of material possessions and social status. He sees these same 'tokens' being plainly displayed by the animals.",
