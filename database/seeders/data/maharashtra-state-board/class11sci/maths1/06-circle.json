    "answer": "<strong>Solution:</strong><br>Step 1: Let the equation of the circle be $x^2+y^2+2gx+2fy+c=0$.<br>Step 2: Since the points lie on the circle, they must satisfy the equation.<br>(i) For (5,7): $25+49+10g+14f+c=0 \\implies 10g+14f+c = -74$.<br>(ii) For (6,6): $36+36+12g+12f+c=0 \\implies 12g+12f+c = -72$.<br>(iii) For (2,-2): $4+4+4g-4f+c=0 \\implies 4g-4f+c = -8$.<br>Step 3: Solve these three linear equations for g, f, and c. Subtracting (iii) from (ii) gives $8g+16f = -64 \\implies g+2f=-8$.<br>Step 4: Subtracting (iii) from (i) gives $6g+18f = -66 \\implies g+3f=-11$.<br>Step 5: Solving these two new equations gives $f=-3$ and $g=-2$.<br>Step 6: Substitute g and f into (iii) to find c: $4(-2)-4(-3)+c=-8 \\implies -8+12+c=-8 \\implies c=-12$.<br><strong>Final Answer:</strong> The equation is $x^2+y^2-4x-6y-12=0$.",
