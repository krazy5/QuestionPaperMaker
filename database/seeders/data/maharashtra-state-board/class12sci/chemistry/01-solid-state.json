In unmagnetized iron, these domains are randomly oriented, so their net magnetic effect is zero. When placed in a magnetic field, the domains align parallel to the field, creating a strong magnetic effect.

    "answer": "(a) **Substitutional Impurity Defect:** This defect arises when some of the regular atoms or ions of the host crystal are replaced by impurity atoms or ions of another substance. This typically occurs when the host and impurity atoms have similar sizes. Example: Brass, where zinc atoms replace copper atoms in the copper lattice.\n(b) **Interstitial Impurity Defect:** This defect occurs when small impurity atoms (like H, C, or N) occupy the empty interstitial sites (voids) in the host crystal lattice without displacing any host atoms. Example: Carbon atoms in the interstitial sites of an iron lattice to form steel.",
