    "answer": "1) The system of inequalities is: \n* $3x + 2y \\leq 18$\n* $2x + y \\leq 10$\n* $x \\geq 0$\n* $y \\geq 0$\nFirst, draw the lines $3x+2y=18$ (intercepts $(6,0)$ and $(0,9)$) and $2x+y=10$ (intercepts $(5,0)$ and $(0,10)$). The inequalities $x \\geq 0$ and $y \\geq 0$ restrict the solution to the first quadrant. For both linear inequalities, testing the origin $(0,0)$ gives true statements, so the feasible region is the area bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the two lines, lying below both lines. The vertices of the feasible region are $(0,0), (5,0), (2,6), (0,9)$.\n\n2) The system of inequalities is: \n* $2x + 3y \\leq 6$\n* $x + y \\geq 2$\n* $x \\geq 0$\n* $y \\geq 0$\nFirst, draw the lines $2x+3y=6$ (intercepts $(3,0)$ and $(0,2)$) and $x+y=2$ (intercepts $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$). The feasible region is in the first quadrant. Testing the origin for $2x+3y \\leq 6$ gives true, so the region is below the line. Testing the origin for $x+y \\geq 2$ gives false, so the region is above the line. The feasible region is the area bounded by the lines and the x and y axes. The vertices of the feasible region are $(3,0)$ and $(0,2)$. The line $x+y=2$ passes through both of these points and the line $2x+3y=6$ also passes through $(3,0)$ and $(0,2)$. Let's re-examine the lines. The lines intersect at $(0,2)$. The line $x+y=2$ also intersects the x-axis at $(2,0)$. The line $2x+3y=6$ intersects the x-axis at $(3,0)$. The feasible region is the area bounded by the lines and the x and y axes. The vertices are $(2,0), (3,0), (0,2)$. The region is the triangle formed by the intersection of the two half-planes. The vertices of the feasible region are $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$. Let's re-examine. The intersection points are $(0,2)$ and $(3,0)$. The line $x+y=2$ and the line $2x+3y=6$ do not form a closed region, because they intersect at $(0,2)$. So there is no closed feasible region. Let's re-check the problem. The feasible region is the triangle with vertices at $(2,0), (0,2)$ and $(3,0)$. Wait, this is wrong. The region satisfying both inequalities is the area between the two lines, with vertices at $(2,0)$, $(3,0)$ and $(0,2)$. This is a non-existent region. Let's re-examine. The region is bounded by $x=0$, $y=0$, $x+y=2$ and $2x+3y=6$. The region below $2x+3y=6$ and above $x+y=2$. The vertices are at the intersection of these lines and the axes. The intersection of $x+y=2$ and $y=0$ is $(2,0)$. The intersection of $2x+3y=6$ and $y=0$ is $(3,0)$. The intersection of $x+y=2$ and $x=0$ is $(0,2)$. The intersection of $2x+3y=6$ and $x=0$ is $(0,2)$. The feasible region is a triangle with vertices at $(2,0), (3,0)$ and $(0,2)$. So the vertices of the feasible region are $(2,0)$ and $(0,2)$, and the third point is the intersection of the two lines, which is $(0,2)$. So the feasible region is a single point $(0,2)$? No. Let's re-check. The feasible region is a triangle with vertices $(2,0), (3,0)$ and $(0,2)$. \n\n3) The system of inequalities is: \n* $3x + 4y \\geq 12$\n* $4x + 7y \\leq 28$\n* $y \\geq 1$\n* $x \\geq 0$\nFirst, draw the lines $3x+4y=12$ (intercepts $(4,0), (0,3)$), $4x+7y=28$ (intercepts $(7,0), (0,4)$), and $y=1$. The region is in the first quadrant and above the line $y=1$. The feasible region is the area between the lines $3x+4y=12$ and $4x+7y=28$ and above the line $y=1$. The vertices are at the intersection of these lines. Intersection of $y=1$ and $3x+4y=12$ is at $3x+4(1)=12 \\implies 3x=8 \\implies x=8/3$. So, $(8/3, 1)$. Intersection of $y=1$ and $4x+7y=28$ is at $4x+7(1)=28 \\implies 4x=21 \\implies x=21/4$. So, $(21/4, 1)$. The third vertex is the intersection of $3x+4y=12$ and $4x+7y=28$. Solving these gives $(x,y)=(4,0)$. But the feasible region is for $y \\geq 1$. Let's recheck. The feasible region is a trapezoid with vertices $(8/3, 1), (21/4, 1), (0,4), (0,3)$. No. The vertices are $(8/3,1), (21/4,1), (0,3)$. No. The feasible region is a trapezoid with vertices at $(8/3, 1), (21/4, 1)$ and the intersection of the two lines. Let's find the intersection. $3x+4y=12$ and $4x+7y=28$. Solving gives $x=4$ and $y=0$. But the feasible region is for $y \\geq 1$. So the intersection point is not in the feasible region. The vertices are $(8/3,1), (21/4,1)$ and $(0,3)$. And the intersection of $4x+7y=28$ and $x=0$ is $(0,4)$. So the feasible region is a trapezoid with vertices $(8/3,1), (21/4,1), (0,4)$ and $(0,3)$. \n\n4) The system of inequalities is: \n* $x + 4y \\leq 24$\n* $3x + y \\leq 21$\n* $x + y \\leq 9$\n* $x \\geq 0$\n* $y \\geq 0$\nFirst, draw the lines $x+4y=24$ (intercepts $(24,0), (0,6)$), $3x+y=21$ (intercepts $(7,0), (0,21)$), and $x+y=9$ (intercepts $(9,0), (0,9)$). The feasible region is in the first quadrant and bounded by these lines. The vertices are at the intersections of these lines and the axes. The vertices are $(0,0), (7,0), (6,3), (4,5), (0,6)$. \n\n5) The system of inequalities is: \n* $0 \\leq x \\leq 3$\n* $0 \\leq y \\leq 3$\n* $x + y \\leq 5$\n* $2x + y \\geq 4$\nThis defines a region within the square bounded by $x=0, x=3, y=0, y=3$. Within this square, we have two more lines. The line $x+y=5$ has intercepts $(5,0)$ and $(0,5)$. The line $2x+y=4$ has intercepts $(2,0)$ and $(0,4)$. The feasible region is the area bounded by these lines. The vertices are at the intersections. The vertices are $(2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (2,3), (1,3), (1,2)$. Let's recheck. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersections of the bounding lines. The vertices are $(2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (2,3), (1,3)$. The vertex is the intersection of $2x+y=4$ and $x=0$, which is $(0,4)$. No. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at $(2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (2,3)$ and the intersection of $x+y=5$ and $2x+y=4$, which is $(-1,6)$. This is not in the feasible region. Let's recheck. The vertices are $(2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (2,3)$ and the intersection of $x+y=5$ and $2x+y=4$ is wrong. The intersection is $(x,y)=(-1,6)$. So this is outside the feasible region. The vertices are at $(2,0), (3,0), (3,2), (2,3)$. \n\n6) The system of inequalities is: \n* $x - 2y \\leq 2$\n* $x + y \\geq 3$\n* $-2x + y \\leq 4$\n* $x \\geq 0$\n* $y \\geq 0$\nThis is restricted to the first quadrant. The lines are $x-2y=2$ (intercepts $(2,0), (0,-1)$), $x+y=3$ (intercepts $(3,0), (0,3)$), and $-2x+y=4$ (intercepts $(-2,0), (0,4)$). The feasible region is the area bounded by these lines. The vertices are at the intersections. The vertices are $(3,0), (0,4), (0,3)$ and the intersection of $x-2y=2$ and $-2x+y=4$, which is $(-2, -2)$. This is not in the first quadrant. Let's re-check. The feasible region is a triangle with vertices at $(3,0), (0,3)$ and the intersection of the two lines. The intersection of $x-2y=2$ and $x+y=3$ is $(8/3, 1/3)$. The intersection of $x-2y=2$ and $-2x+y=4$ is $(-2,-2)$. This is not in the feasible region. The intersection of $x+y=3$ and $-2x+y=4$ is $(-1/3, 10/3)$. This is not in the feasible region. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at the intersections of the bounding lines. The vertices are $(3,0), (0,3)$ and $(8/3, 1/3)$. \n\n7) Let $x$ be the number of units of article A and $y$ be the number of units of article B. The problem is to maximize the production of articles A and B. \nSilver constraint: $3x + 2y \\leq 6$\nGold constraint: $1x + 2y \\leq 4$\nNon-negativity constraints: $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$\nThe feasible region is in the first quadrant. The lines are $3x+2y=6$ (intercepts $(2,0)$ and $(0,3)$) and $x+2y=4$ (intercepts $(4,0)$ and $(0,2)$). The feasible region is the area bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the two lines. The vertices are $(0,0), (2,0), (1,1.5), (0,2)$. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at $(0,0), (2,0), (1,1.5)$ and $(0,2)$. \n\n8) Let $x$ be the number of tables and $y$ be the number of chairs. The constraints are: \nInvestment constraint: $1500x + 750y \\leq 150000 \\implies 2x + y \\leq 200$\nStorage space constraint: $x + y \\leq 60$\nNon-negativity constraints: $x \\geq 0, y \\geq 0$\nThe feasible region is in the first quadrant. The lines are $2x+y=200$ (intercepts $(100,0)$ and $(0,200)$) and $x+y=60$ (intercepts $(60,0)$ and $(0,60)$). The feasible region is the area bounded by the x-axis, y-axis, and the two lines. The vertices are at the intersections. The vertices are $(0,0), (60,0), (40,20), (0,60)$. The feasible region is a polygon with vertices at $(0,0), (60,0), (40,20)$ and $(0,60)$.",
