The 3d orbitals contain three paired and two unpaired electrons. \n4.  **Hybridization:** Since the inner 3d orbitals are not vacant, the four electron pairs from the four $Cl^-$ ligands occupy the empty outer orbitals: one 4s and three 4p. This results in **$sp^3$ hybridization**. \n5.  **Geometry:** $sp^3$ hybridization corresponds to a **tetrahedral** geometry. \n6.  **Magnetic Property:** The complex has two unpaired electrons in the 3d orbitals. Therefore, it is **paramagnetic**.",

    "answer": "Ionization isomers are coordination compounds that have the same overall chemical formula but differ in the ions present inside and outside the coordination sphere. They yield different ions when dissolved in a solvent. For example, $[Co(NH_3)_5SO_4]Br$ and $[Co(NH_3)_5Br]SO_4$ are ionization isomers.",

    "answer": "The effective atomic number (EAN) is given by the formula: EAN = Z - X + Y. \nFor the complex ion $[Co(NH_3)_6]^{3+}$: \n-   Z = Atomic number of Cobalt = 27. \n-   X = Oxidation state of Co. As $NH_3$ is a neutral ligand, the oxidation state of Co is +3. \n-   Y = Total electrons donated by ligands. There are 6 ammonia ligands, each donating a pair of electrons (2 electrons). So, Y = $6 \\times 2 = 12$. \nEAN = $27 - 3 + 12 = 36$. \nThe EAN of cobalt in the complex is 36, which is the atomic number of the noble gas Krypton.",

The primary valency corresponds to the oxidation state of the metal and is satisfied by anions. \n3.  The secondary valency corresponds to the coordination number of the metal, is fixed, and is satisfied by ligands. \n4.
