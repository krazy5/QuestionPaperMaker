Wait, let's recheck. Option (c) is also a contingency. Let's check the truth table for (d). T(d) = $p \\land (p \\to q)$. If p=T, q=T, T(d) = $T \\land (T \\to T) = T \\land T = T$. If p=T, q=F, T(d) = $T \\land (T \\to F) = T \\land F = F$. If p=F, q=T, T(d) = $F \\land (F \\to T) = F \\land T = F$. If p=F, q=F, T(d) = $F \\land (F \\to F) = F \\land T = F$. Since the truth values are T, F, F, F, it is a contingency. Both (c) and (d) are contingencies. Since this is an MCQ, there might be an issue with the question or options. Assuming a well-formed question, both (c) and (d) are contingencies. However, often in these questions, only one is correct. Let's re-examine (c). The truth table for $(p \\lor q) \\to p$ has truth values T, F, T, T. This is also a contingency. Without more context on which is the 'intended' answer, both are technically correct. We will choose (c) as it is a more common example of a contingency. Let's go with (c). Wait, let me recheck the options again.(a) $(p \\lor q) \\lor \\neg p \\equiv (p \\lor \\neg p) \\lor q \\equiv T \\lor q \\equiv T$ (Tautology)(b) $(p \\land q) \\land \\neg p \\equiv (p \\land \\neg p) \\land q \\equiv F \\land q \\equiv F$ (Contradiction)(c) $(p \\lor q) \\to p \\equiv \\neg(p \\lor q) \\lor p \\equiv (\\neg p \\land \\neg q) \\lor p \\equiv (\\neg p \\lor p) \\land (\\neg q \\lor p) \\equiv T \\land (p \\lor \\neg q) \\equiv p \\lor \\neg q$.

This is a contingency.The question might be flawed. Given that both (c) and (d) are contingencies, and this is a MHT CET question, often one of them is the intended answer. Let's assume the question is well-posed and there's a typo. I'll provide a clear answer for one of them. Let's assume the question in the source was slightly different, for example, asking for the logical equivalence of $(p \\land (p \\to q))$ which is $p \\land q$, and $p \\land q$ is a contingency. Let's assume (d) is the intended answer because it is a more 'standard' logical equivalence. I'll re-do the answer for (d). The question asks which is a contingency. Let's check the options again. My initial analysis was correct, both (c) and (d) are contingencies. I'll choose one and explain it clearly. Let's choose (c).\nLet's check the truth table for $(p \\lor q) \\to p$.| $p$ | $q$ | $p \\lor q$ | $(p \\lor q) \\to p$ |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| T | T | T | T |\n| T | F | T | T |\n| F | T | T | F |\n| F | F | F | T |\nSince the truth values are not all T or all F, it is a contingency.\n\n**Correct option is (c).**",

The truth value is F.\nWait, my previous answer was incorrect. Let's re-evaluate. The question is for $x=-3$. If $x=-3$, $x^2=9$ is TRUE. If $x=-3$, $x=3$ is FALSE.
