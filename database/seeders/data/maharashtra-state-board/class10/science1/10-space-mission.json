It is the velocity at which the gravitational force of the body is perfectly balanced by the centripetal force required to keep the satellite in its orbit.\n\n* **If the velocity is less than orbital velocity**, the satellite will be pulled in by gravity and fall to Earth in a spiral path.\n* **If the velocity is greater than orbital velocity**, the satellite will fly off into space along a parabolic or hyperbolic path.",

Without a launch vehicle, the satellite would simply fall back to Earth.\n\n### **Working Principle**\nLaunch vehicles work on Newton's third law of motion, which states that for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction. The hot gases produced by the burning of fuel are expelled at a very high velocity from the nozzle of the rocket (action). This creates a reactive force (reaction) in the opposite direction, which pushes the rocket forward and upwards. As the rocket ascends, its different stages fire in succession and are discarded, reducing the rocket's weight and increasing its efficiency.",
