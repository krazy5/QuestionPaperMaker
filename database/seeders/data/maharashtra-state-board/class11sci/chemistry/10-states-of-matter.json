    "answer": "Hot air balloons float because the air inside the balloon has a lower density than the cooler air outside. This is explained by **Charles's Law**, which states that at constant pressure, the volume of a gas is directly proportional to its absolute temperature. When the air inside the balloon is heated, its temperature increases, causing its volume to expand. Since the mass of the air remains constant, this increase in volume leads to a decrease in its density ($\\text{Density} = \\frac{\\text{Mass}}{\\text{Volume}}$). The balloon, filled with less dense hot air, experiences a buoyant force from the surrounding cooler, denser air, which lifts the balloon.",
