    "answer": "Solubility product ($K_{sp}$) is defined as the equilibrium constant for a sparingly soluble salt. For a saturated solution, it is the product of the molar concentrations of its constituent ions, with each concentration term raised to the power of its stoichiometric coefficient in the balanced equilibrium equation. \n\nFor $PbI_2$, the dissociation equilibrium in a saturated solution is: \n$PbI_{2(s)} \\rightleftharpoons Pb^{2+}_{(aq)} + 2I^{-}_{(aq)}$. \nLet 'S' be the molar solubility of $PbI_2$ in mol/L. According to the stoichiometry: \n$[Pb^{2+}] = S$ \n$[I^-] = 2S$ \nThe solubility product expression is: \n$K_{sp} = [Pb^{2+}][I^-]^2$. \nSubstituting the equilibrium concentrations in terms of S: \n$K_{sp} = (S)(2S)^2 = S(4S^2) = 4S^3$. \nThus, the relationship is $K_{sp} = 4S^3$.",
