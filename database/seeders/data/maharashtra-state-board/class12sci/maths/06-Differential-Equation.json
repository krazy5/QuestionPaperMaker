    "text": "Q) A person's assets start reducing in such a way that the rate of reduction of assets is proportional to the square root of the assets existing at that moment. If the assets at the beginning are ₹10 lakhs and they dwindle down to ₹10,000 after 2 years, show that the person will be bankrupt in $2\\frac{2}{9}$ years from the start.",
    "answer": "Let $A(t)$ be the assets at time $t$. The rate of reduction of assets is proportional to the square root of the assets, so $\\frac{dA}{dt} = -k\\sqrt{A}$ for some constant $k$. This is a variable separable differential equation. Rearranging gives $\\frac{dA}{\\sqrt{A}} = -k dt \\implies A^{-1/2}dA = -k dt$. Integrating both sides: $\\int A^{-1/2}dA = \\int -k dt \\implies 2A^{1/2} = -kt+C$. So, $2\\sqrt{A} = -kt+C$. We are given that the initial assets are ₹10 lakhs, so $A(0) = 1000000$. Substituting in: $2\\sqrt{1000000} = -k(0)+C \\implies 2(1000) = C \\implies C=2000$. The equation is $2\\sqrt{A} = -kt+2000$. We are also given that the assets are ₹10,000 after 2 years, so $A(2)=10000$. Substituting in: $2\\sqrt{10000} = -k(2)+2000 \\implies 2(100) = -2k+2000 \\implies 200 = -2k+2000 \\implies 2k = 1800 \\implies k=900$. The equation for the assets is $2\\sqrt{A} = -900t+2000$. The person is bankrupt when the assets are zero, so $A(T)=0$. Substituting in: $2\\sqrt{0} = -900T+2000 \\implies 0 = -900T+2000 \\implies 900T = 2000 \\implies T = \\frac{2000}{900} = \\frac{20}{9}$ years. $T = \\frac{18+2}{9} = 2 + \\frac{2}{9}$. Thus, the person will be bankrupt in $2\\frac{2}{9}$ years from the start.",
