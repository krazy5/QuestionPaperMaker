    "answer": "First, we verify the conditions of Rolle's theorem for $f(x)=(x-2)\\log x$ on $[1, 2]$. The function is continuous on $[1, 2]$ and differentiable on $(1, 2)$. We check the endpoints: $f(1)=(1-2)\\log 1 = -1(0)=0$ and $f(2)=(2-2)\\log 2 = 0(\\log 2)=0$. Since $f(1)=f(2)$, Rolle's theorem applies. This guarantees that there exists at least one value $c \\in (1, 2)$ such that $f'(c)=0$. Let's find the derivative using the product rule: $f'(x) = (1)(\\log x) + (x-2)(\\frac{1}{x}) = \\log x + 1 - \\frac{2}{x}$. Setting $f'(c)=0$ gives $\\log c + 1 - \\frac{2}{c} = 0$.

    "answer": "Let the cone have height $H$ and radius $R$. Let the inscribed cylinder have height $h$ and radius $r$. By similar triangles (using a cross-section), we have the relation $\\frac{H-h}{r} = \\frac{H}{R}$, which gives $h = H(1 - \\frac{r}{R})$. The volume of the cylinder is $V = \\pi r^2 h$. Substituting for $h$: $V(r) = \\pi r^2 H(1-\\frac{r}{R}) = \\pi H (r^2 - \\frac{r^3}{R})$. To maximize the volume, we differentiate with respect to $r$: $\\frac{dV}{dr} = \\pi H (2r - \\frac{3r^2}{R})$. Setting $\\frac{dV}{dr}=0$ gives $2r = \\frac{3r^2}{R}$, which for $r \\neq 0$ gives $r=\\frac{2R}{3}$. The corresponding height of the cylinder is $h=H(1 - \\frac{2R/3}{R}) = H(1-\\frac{2}{3}) = \\frac{H}{3}$. Thus, the cylinder has maximum volume when its height is one-third the height of the cone.",

The apex of the cone can be at $(0, r)$ and its base on a plane $y=r-h$.
