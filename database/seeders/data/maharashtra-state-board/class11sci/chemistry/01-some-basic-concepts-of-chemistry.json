    "answer": "The chemical formula for acetaldehyde is $CH_3CHO$, which can be simplified to $C_2H_4O$.<br>In one mole of acetaldehyde, there are: 2 moles of Carbon atoms, 4 moles of Hydrogen atoms, and 1 mole of Oxygen atoms.<br>Since we have 2 moles of acetaldehyde:<br><strong>a. Number of moles of carbon:</strong> $2 \\text{ moles of } C_2H_4O \\times \\frac{2 \\text{ moles of C}}{1 \\text{ mole of } C_2H_4O} = 4$ moles of Carbon.<br><strong>b. Number of moles of hydrogen:</strong> $2 \\text{ moles of } C_2H_4O \\times \\frac{4 \\text{ moles of H}}{1 \\text{ mole of } C_2H_4O} = 8$ moles of Hydrogen.<br><strong>c. Number of moles of oxygen:</strong> $2 \\text{ moles of } C_2H_4O \\times \\frac{1 \\text{ mole of O}}{1 \\text{ mole of } C_2H_4O} = 2$ moles of Oxygen.<br><strong>d. Number of molecules of acetaldehyde:</strong><br>Number of molecules = Moles of acetaldehyde $\\times$ Avogadro's number = $2 \\times 6.022 \\times 10^{23} = 1.2044 \\times 10^{24}$ molecules.",

    "answer": "<strong>a. The need for the term average atomic mass:</strong> The average atomic mass is needed because most elements exist as a mixture of two or more isotopes. Each isotope has a different mass, so the average atomic mass is a weighted average of the masses of these isotopes, taking into account their natural abundance. It is the value used for calculations in chemistry.<br><strong>b. Molar mass:</strong> Molar mass is the mass in grams of one mole of a substance. It is numerically equal to the average atomic or molecular mass, but expressed in grams per mole (g/mol). For example, the molar mass of water ($H_2O$) is approximately 18 g/mol.<br><strong>c. Mole concept:</strong> The mole is the SI unit for the amount of a substance. The mole concept is a way of counting atoms or molecules by weighing them. One mole of any substance contains Avogadro's number ($6.022 \\times 10^{23}$) of particles. It is the bridge between the macroscopic world (grams) and the microscopic world (atoms and molecules).<br><strong>d. Formula mass with an example:</strong> Formula mass is the sum of the atomic masses of all atoms in a formula unit of an ionic compound. It is used for ionic compounds because they do not exist as discrete molecules. Example: The formula mass of sodium chloride (NaCl) is the sum of the atomic mass of Na (23 u) and Cl (35.5 u), which is 58.5 u.<br><strong>e. Molar volume of gas:</strong> Molar volume is the volume occupied by one mole of any gas at a specific temperature and pressure. At Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP), the molar volume of an ideal gas is approximately 22.4 liters.<br><strong>f. Types of matter (on the basis of chemical composition):</strong> Matter can be classified into two main categories: pure substances and mixtures. <strong>Pure substances</strong> have a fixed composition and can be either <strong>elements</strong> (e.g., gold, oxygen) or <strong>compounds</strong> (e.g., water, salt). <strong>Mixtures</strong> have a variable composition and can be either <strong>homogeneous</strong> (uniform, e.g., saltwater, air) or <strong>heterogeneous</strong> (non-uniform, e.g., sand and water, salad).",
